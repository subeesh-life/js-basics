    //Array Filter
    //filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
    //The filter() method does not execute the function for empty elements.
    //The filter() method does not change the original array.

    //Example One
    const ages = [12, 34, 56, 78, 90, 23, 45, 67, 89, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100];
    const adults = ages.filter((age) => age >= 18);
    console.log(adults); //[34, 56, 78, 90, 23, 45, 67, 89, 10, 20, 30, 40,

    //Example Two - Find Event Numbers
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
    const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((number) => number % 2 === 0);
    console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

    //Same Example 2 in For Each Method
    const numbers2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
    const evenNumbers2 = [];
    numbers2.forEach((number) => {
      if (number % 2 === 0) {
        evenNumbers2.push(number);
      }
    });
