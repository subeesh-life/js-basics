    // Syntax = condition ? true : false;
    // Example = a > b ? "a is greater than b" : "b is greater than a";

    // Example One
    let a = 10;
    let b = 20;
    let c = a > b ? "a is greater than b" : "b is greater than a";

    let e = 20;
    let f = d > e ? "d is greater than e" : "e is greater than d";

    //Example thee
    const age = 20;
    age >= 18 ? console.log("You are eligible to vote") : console.log("You are not eligible to vote")

    //Assigning a conditional value to a variable
